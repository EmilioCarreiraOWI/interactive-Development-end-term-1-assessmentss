# About SpaceX

I was introduced to charts.js and the React app for the first time this term. The website's goal was to compare products more thoroughly via an API request. In my case, I used the SpaceX API to compare the two rockets and determine the total number of rocket launches.

## The Idea

The website's concept is to compare rockets with one another to see if any of them successfully launched or failed. The timeline served as a means of displaying the annual number of rocket launches.

## Development Process

### Highlights
* Highlights of the website is the simplistic UI and the functionality that gives the user a pleasant user experience.
* The website is easy to understand and navigate.
* The website makes use of [Quill.js](https://quilljs.com) rich text editor for seamless post creation and styling.

### Challenges
* Future proofing the website in a functional yet optimised way that makes use of components and templates where possible to keep the website running smooth and simplify updates in the future
* Building the website in such a way that everything is automated, from automatically creating user profiles and displaying only their own posts to creating new communities and automatically generating a community page and adding it to the navbar.

## Future Implementations

* Allow Users to view other user Profiles
* Add admin and moderator functionality to each community
* Add super admin functionality that allows Open Window staff to post announcements and event details to the home page
* Allow any student to create their own communities for something like a horror club, DnD club etc.
