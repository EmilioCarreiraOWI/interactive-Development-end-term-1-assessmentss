# About SpaceX

I was introduced to charts.js and the React app for the first time this term. The website's goal was to compare products more thoroughly via an API request. In my case, I used the SpaceX API to compare the two rockets and determine the total number of rocket launches.

```
git clone https://github.com/EmilioCarreiraOWI/DV200_Group1_Term4
```

Navigate to the 'client' folder to install all the dependencies
```
npm i
```

Run the build on your local host
```
npm start
```


## The Idea

The website's concept is to compare rockets with one another to see if any of them successfully launched or failed. The timeline served as a means of displaying the annual number of rocket launches.

## Development Process

### Challenges
* One of my biggest problems was that, for some reason, I was unable to display the Chartjs on my website. Nevertheless, I found another solution and used Google Charts to fulfil the website's minimal requirements. These days, rockets can demonstrate whether a rocket launch was successful or not.
